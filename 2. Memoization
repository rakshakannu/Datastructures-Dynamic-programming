Example= fibanocci series

we can observe that there are lot of sub problems that are getting repeated.
using normal recirsive solution, we get exponential time complexity
using memoization, we can optimise it to linear time

what is memo array?
it is an array declared globally and all the values in the array are initialized as -1
