// tabulation is a bottom up approach
// we would have already computed values of fun(1), fun(2), fun(3) unlike the top down approach.
// the rules to make the array and decide the size of the array is same

 int fib(int n)
 {
  int f(n+1);  // this is a memo array being initialized
  f(0)=0;
  f(1)=1;
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    f(i) = f(i-1)+f(i-2);
  
  return f(n);
 }
 
 time: O(n)
 space: theta(n+1) = theta(n)
 
 Side note: finding nth fibanocci number has a better solution
 time: O(logn)
 using the method of matrix multiplication and divide and conquer
 
 // dynamic programming is just a name given to this process and it has got no significance
 
 // memoisation VS tabulation
 
 memoisation is very easy to implement once there is a recursion solution
 tabulation is difficult to implement - this does not require recursion, so it is faster
