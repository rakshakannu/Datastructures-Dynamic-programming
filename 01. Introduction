// in simple words dynamic programming is optimization over plain recursion
// take inputs of sub problem and compute the main problem

// the idea is to reuse the solution when there are overlapping subproblem
1. memoization (top down)
2. tabulation (bottom up)

// Applications of dynamic programming algorithms

1. Bellman form algorithm
2. Floyd warhsall algorithm
3. Diff utility(Longest Common Subsequence) - in Git to check what we removed and what we added
4. Search closed words (Edit distance)
5. Resource allocation (0-1 knapsack)
